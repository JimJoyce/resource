A way to actually learn.

##standups
#### Come prepared. If you're working, you'll have something to say you did.

* What did you do?
* What do you want to do next?
* What are you struggling with?
* If you have any tips to share that you found out about, share them.
* Everyone answers these questions and then the floor is open for conversation. Let them get out everything.

Morning - 8:15 AM
Morning(non-technical) - 10:15 AM
Afternoon -  12:45 PM
Evening - 4:30 PM

##General rules
# DONT EVER PUSH TO OR BREAK MASTER. YOU WILL GET BRANGED.

* Lunch is still the same time everyday. Feel free to keep coding, but you probably shouldn't be.
* It's encouraged to get lunch together!
* Also snack trips are awesome.


* Nathan is project manager
*   Always knows what people are doing
*   Knows what's next for the project

* Set aside a small period of time every day for non technical stuff.
* Check in and make sure no one is going crazy or wants to kill eachother.

* If everyone is still here at 8 and working, check ins held and if you feel like you need to take the night off and come fresh tomorrow, do it.

# MVP IS EVERYTHING
#### How do we get there?
* Make good use of icebox. That's where the stretch lives. Post it and drop it till were there.
* Don't be afraid to sacrafice.
* Limit new tech.
* Make sure everyone sees the same finished product

##### Workflow
* Using whiteboards.
* If you finish something, let everyone know, high five yourself and scream at the top of your lungs.

## Testing
* Every push must have at least 1 feature test.

## Group dynamics
* If you're stuck for more than 15 minutes, get help.
* Go to someone in the group first. If you guys both can't figure out what the problem is then go to a teacher.
* Pair more often during setups. Pair more often during new tech intros.
* Pair less when you know that it wouldn't be adventageous to the speed and flow of things.
* Fork or branch, just keep it tidy people.
* Freely express your pairing preference at stand ups.
* Be in the mindset that we're always pseudo pairing, everyone is here to help each other.


## Conflict Resolution
* Objective - Explain your thinking (pros/cons) such that group can agree on best course (consensus).
* Rate from 1-10 your level of concern
* Timebox to 30 minutes with vote resolution. Clock stops if a break is neaded to collect oneself.
* If vote is deadlocked, seek arbitration from Lucas/Casey/Leon/Alex
